# Women-Security
This project is made using c++ indicating the safest and shortest path from any source to a destination using optimised djikstra's algorithm. 
It represents a grid as a map and its coordinates as locations.
Various landmarks such as a police station, hospital, alcohol shop and supermarkets are also allocated on the grid and given fixed safety points to enhance realtime experience.
Source and destination are taken as input and a suitable path is returned.
C graphics was used to enhance user experience.
